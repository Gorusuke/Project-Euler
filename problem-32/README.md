# Problem 32: Pandigital products

We shall say that an `n`-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through `n` pandigital.

Hint: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

```javascript
pandigitalProducts(4) // 12
pandigitalProducts(6) // 162
pandigitalProducts(7) // 0
pandigitalProducts(8) // 13458
pandigitalProducts(9) // 45228
```
