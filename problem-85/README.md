Although there may not exists a rectangular grid that contains exactly `n` rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.

```javascript
countingRectangles(18) // 6
countingRectangles(250) // 22
countingRectangles(50000) // 364
countingRectangles(1000000) // 1632
countingRectangles(2000000) // 2772
```
