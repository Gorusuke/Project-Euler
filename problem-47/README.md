# Problem 47: Distinct primes factors

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7 <br>
15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 22 × 7 × 23 <br>
645 = 3 × 5 × 43 <br>
646 = 2 × 17 × 19

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

```javascript
distinctPrimeFactors(2, 2) // 14
distinctPrimeFactors(3, 3) // 644
distinctPrimeFactors(4, 4) // 134043
```
