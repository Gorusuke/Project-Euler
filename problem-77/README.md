# Problem 77: Prime summations

It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

7 + 3 <br>
5 + 5 <br>
5 + 3 + 2 <br>
3 + 3 + 2 + 2 <br>
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over n ways?

```javascript
primeSummations(5) // 11
primeSummations(100) // 31
primeSummations(1000) // 53
primeSummations(5000) // 71
```
