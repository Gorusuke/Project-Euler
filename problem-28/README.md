# Problem 28: Number spiral diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25 red <br>
20 07 08 09 10 <br>
19 06 01 02 11 <br>
18 05 04 03 12 <br>
17 16 15 14 13 <br>

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in an `n` by `n` spiral formed in the same way?

```javascript
spiralDiagonals(101) // 692101
spiralDiagonals(303) // 18591725
spiralDiagonals(505) // 85986601
spiralDiagonals(1001) // 669171001
```
