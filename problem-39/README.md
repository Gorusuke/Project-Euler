# Problem 39: Integer right triangles

If `p` is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of `p` â‰¤ `n`, is the number of solutions maximized?

```javascript
intRightTriangles(500) // 420
intRightTriangles(800) // 720
intRightTriangles(900) // 840
intRightTriangles(1000) // 840
```
