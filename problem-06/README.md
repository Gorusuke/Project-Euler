# Problem 6: Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385 <br>
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025 <br>
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers and the square of the sum.

```javascript
sumSquareDifference(10) // 2640
sumSquareDifference(20) // 41230
sumSquareDifference(100) // 25164150
```
