# Problem 36: Double-base palindromes

The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001<sub>2</sub> (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than `n`, whereas 1000 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000000, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

```javascript
doubleBasePalindromes(1000) // 1772
doubleBasePalindromes(50000) // 105795
doubleBasePalindromes(500000) // 286602
doubleBasePalindromes(1000000) // 872187
```
