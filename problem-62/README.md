# Problem 62: Cubic permutations\

The cube, 41063625 (345<sup>3</sup>), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (384<sup>3</sup>) and 66430125 (405<sup>3</sup>). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly `n` permutations of its digits are cube.

```javascript
cubicPermutations(2) // 125
cubicPermutations(3) // 41063625
cubicPermutations(4) // 1006012008
cubicPermutations(5) // 127035954683
```
