# Problem 61: Cyclical figurate numbers

Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:

| Type of Number | Formula | Sequence |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| Triangle | P<sub>3</sub>(n) = n(n+1)/2 | 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... |
| Square | P<sub>4</sub>(n) = n<sup>2</sup> | 	1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... |
| Pentagonal | P<sub>5</sub>(n) = n(3n−1)/2 | 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... |
| Hexagonal | P<sub>6</sub>(n) = n(2n−1) | 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... |
| Heptagonal | P<sub>7</sub>(n) = n(5n−3)/2 | 1, 7, 18, 34, 55, ... |
| Octagonal | P<sub>8</sub>(n) = n(3n − 2) | 1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ... |

The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties.

- The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).
- Each polygonal type: triangle (P<sub>3</sub>(127) = 8128), square (P<sub>4</sub>(91) = 8281), and pentagonal (P<sub>5</sub>(44) = 2882), is represented by a different number in the set.
- This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.

Find the sum of all numbers in ordered sets of `n` cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each of the P3 to Pn+2 polygonal types, is represented by a different number in the set.
