# Problem 45: Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

- Triangle => T<sub>n</sub>=n(n+1)/2 => 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ... <br>
- Pentagonal => P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n−1)/2 => 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ... <br>
- Hexagonal => H<sub>n</sub>=n(2n−1) => 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ... <br>

It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

triPentaHexa(40756) // 1533776805
