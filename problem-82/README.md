# Problem 82: Path sum: three ways

Note: This problem is a more challenging version of Problem 81.

The minimal path sum in the 5 by 5 matrix below, by starting in any cell in the left column and finishing in any cell in the right column, and only moving up, down, and right, is indicated in red and bold; the sum is equal to `994`.

131 673 `234` `103` `18` <br>
`201` `96` `342` 965 150 <br>
630 803 746 422 111 <br>
537 699 497 121 956 <br>
805 732 524 37 331

Find the minimal path sum from the left column to the right column in `matrix`, a 2D array representing a matrix. The maximum matrix size used in tests will be 80 by 80.

```javascript
pathSumThreeWays(testMatrix1) // 994
pathSumThreeWays(testMatrix2) // 260324
```
