# Problem 81: Path sum: two ways

In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right, by only moving to the right and down, is indicated in bold red and is equal to `2427`.

`131` 673 234 103 18 <br>
`201` `96` `342` 965 150 <br>
630 803 `746` `422` 111 <br>
537 699 497 `121` 956 <br>
805 732 524 `37` `331`

Find the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right by only moving right and down in `matrix`, a 2D array representing a matrix. The maximum matrix size used in the tests will be 80 by 80.

```javascript
pathSumTwoWays(testMatrix1) // 2427
pathSumTwoWays(testMatrix2) // 427337
```
