# Problem 42: Coded triangle numbers

The `n`<sup>th</sup> term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, `tn` = Â½`n`(`n`+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = `t`<sub>10</sub>. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words array of `n`-length, how many are triangle words?

```javascript
codedTriangleNumbers(1400) // 129
codedTriangleNumbers(1500) // 137
codedTriangleNumbers(1600) // 141
codedTriangleNumbers(1786) // 162
```
